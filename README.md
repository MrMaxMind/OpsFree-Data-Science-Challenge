# OpsFree Internship Challenge

### Data Science Internship Challenge

Welcome to the repository for the OpsFree Data Science Internship Challenge. In this project, I conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on microservice tracing data.

---

## Overview

This challenge involves performing an in-depth EDA to uncover insights from the given dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical summarization. 

---

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, data type conversion, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Data Transformation**: Aggregating and summarizing data to reveal meaningful patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative plots to visualize distributions, trends, and relationships within the data.

---

## Contents

- `traces_data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `eda_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete EDA process.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Key Insights
- Identified patterns in service durations.
- Visualized the distribution of trace durations.
- Grouped data by service and method to find average durations.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- `Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `Matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- `Seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `tqdm`: For displaying progress bars.
